\subsection{The Schlaefli Graph}

The Schlaefli graph is defined as follows. 
Consider the variety $x^3+y^3+z^3+w^3 = 0$ over $\PG(3,4).$  
Vertices are the $27$ projective lines contained in the variety.
Two vertices are adjacent if the associated lines are disjoint.
Here is a program to create the Schlaefli graphs:

{\small
{\tt
\input CODE/schlaefli.tex
}
}

%Here is the output of the program:

Here is a drawing of the Schlaefli graph.
