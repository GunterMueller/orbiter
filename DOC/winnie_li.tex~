\subsection{Winnie Li Graphs}


Another family of graphs was introduced by Winnie Li in the 1991 paper 
{\em Character Sums and Abelian Ramanujan Graphs}. 
Here is a program to create these graphs. 
The construction relies on the norm map from $\bbF_q$ over a subfield.
The graph is a Cayley graph $\Cay(G,S)$ where $G$ is the additive group of $\bbF_q$ 
and $S$ is the elements whose relative norm with respect to the subfield is one.

%Here is the output of the program for $q=5$ and $p=29$:

Here are the graphs created for $q=16$ (left) and $q=25$ (right).
