\subsection{Johnson Graphs}

The Johnson graph $J(n,k,s)$ is defined as follows. Vertices are the $k$-subsets of an $n$-element set. 
Two vertices are connected if the associated sets intersect in exactly $s$ elements. 
Here is a program to create the Johnson graphs:

{\small
{\tt
\input CODE/johnson.tex
}
}


Here is a drawing of the Johnson graph $J(5,2,0).$ 
This graph is better known as the Petersen graph.
$$
\input GRAPHICS/Johnson_5_2_0_on_circle.tex
$$


The vertices of the graph are in correspondence to the subsets of a set. 
The subsets are 
listed in the lexicographical order. 
Here is a program to create the subsets of size $k$ of $1,\ldots,n$ 
in lexicographic order. 

{\small
{\tt
\input CODE/all_k_subsets.tex
}
}
The subsets are written to a file:
{\small
{\tt
\input CODE/all_k_subsets_5_2_tree.tex
}
}
This is a drawing of the tree of subsets:

Here is $J(7,3,1)$
$$
\input GRAPHICS/Johnson_7_3_1_on_circle.tex
$$
This is the tree of $3$-subsets of $\{1,\ldots,7\}$:
