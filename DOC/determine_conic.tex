\subsection{Determining The Equation of a Conic }

In the projective plane, five points with the property that no three collinear determine a conic. 
Here is a program to compute the equation of the conic given 5 points. 


{\small
{\tt
\input CODE/determine_conic.tex
}
}


Suppose we are in the plane defined over $\bbF_5,$ and we are looking for the equation of the 
conic through the points 
$(0, 0, 1),$  
$(1, 1, 1),$ 
$(2, 4, 1),$ 
$(3, 4, 1),$ 
$(4, 1, 1).$
Here is the output of the program:


{\tt
\input CODE/determine_conic_out.tex
}

The program correctly finds that the given points lie on the conic $X^2-YZ.$
