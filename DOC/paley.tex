\subsection{Paley Graphs}

Another class of graphs are the Paley graphs.
A Paley graph can be constructed using a finite field of order $q$, where 
$q$ is an odd prime power. 
In addition, we require that $q$ is congruent 1 modulo $4$ 
(otherwise, we would create a tournament). 
The vertices of the Paley graph are the $q$ elements 
of the field $\bbF_q.$
Two vertices $i$ and $j$ are adjacent if $i-j$ is a nonzero square in $\bbF_q.$ 
Here is a program to create Paley graphs of order $q$:

Here is a drawing of the Paley graph created for $q=13$:
